Smartcards can be used on a macOS for the following:\n\n  * Authentication (Loginwindow, Screensaver, SSH, PKINIT, Safari, Finder, and PAM Authorization (`sudo`, `login`, and `su`) )\n  * Digital Encryption\n  * Digital Signing\n  * Remote Access (VPN:L2TP)\n  * Port-based Network Access Control (802.1X)\n  * Keychain Unlock\n\nmacOS has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant smartcard readers.\n\n[discrete]\n==== Smartcard Pairing\nThe default method for using smartcards in macOS is a method called \"local account pairing\". Local account pairing is automatically initiated when a user inserts a smartcard into the Mac. The user is prompted to pair their smartcard with their account. If a user receives a new smartcard, the previous card must be unpaired, and the new card paired to the account. Local account pairing employs fixed key mapping with the hash of a public key on the user's smartcard with a local account.\n\n[discrete]\n==== Smartcard Attribute Mapping\nSmartcards can be used to authenticate against a directory via attribute mapping configured in `\/private\/etc\/SmartcardLogin.plist`. This file takes precedence over local account pairing. Attribute mapping matches the configured certificate field values from the smart card to the value in a directory. This may be used with network accounts, mobile accounts, or local accounts.\n\n[discrete]\n==== Smartcard Management in macOS\n\nThe following settings are available to manage smartcards (com.apple.security.smartcard):\n\n[%header,cols=\"2,1,7\"]\n|===\n|Key\n|Type\n|Value\n\n<.^|userPairing\n^.^|bool\n|If false, users will not get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings will still work.\n\n<.^|allowSmartCard\n^.^|bool\n|If false, the SmartCard is disabled for logins, authorizations, and screensaver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails and web access. A restart is required for a change of setting to take effect.\n\n<.^|checkCertificateTrust\n^.^|int\na|Valid values are 0-3:\n\n- 0: certificate trust check is turned off\n\n- 1: certificate trust check is turned on. Standard validity check is being performed but this does not include additional revocation checks.\n\n- 2: certificate trust check is turned on, and a soft revocation check is performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL\/OCSP, it is considered valid. This implies that unavailable\/unreachable CRL\/OCSP allows this check to succeed.\n\n- 3: certificate trust check is turned on, plus a hard revocation check is performed. Unless CRL\/OCSP explicitly states that \"this certificate is OK\", the certificate is considered invalid. This is the most secure value for this setting.\n\n<.^|oneCardPerUser\n^.^|bool\n|If true, a user can pair with only one smartcard, although existing pairings will be allowed if already set up.\n\n<.^|enforceSmartCard\n^.^|bool\n|If true, a user can only login or authenticate with a smartcard.\n\n<.^|tokenRemovalAction\n^.^|int\n|If 1, the screen saver will automatically when the smartcard is removed.\n\n<.^|allowUnmappedUsers\n^.^|int\n|If 1, allows users who are in a directory group to be exempt from smartcard-only enforcement. The group allowed for exemption is defined in \/private\/etc\/SmartcardLogin.plist\n\n|===\n\nA custom configuration profile (`com.apple.loginwindow`) should be created to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled. This ensures that authorized users boot their Macs, enter a password at the pre-boot screen (which decrypts the boot volume), and are then presented with a login window where they can authenticate with a smartcard.\n\n[%header,cols=\"2,1,7\"]\n|===\n|Key\n|Type\n|Value\n\n<.^|DisableFDEAutoLogin\n^.^|bool\n|If true, both Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) login password and loginwindow PIN are required.\n\n|===\n\nNOTE: DisableFDEAutoLogin does not have to be set on Apple Silicon based macOS systems that are smartcard enforced as smartcards are available at pre-boot.\n\n[discrete]\n==== Trusted Authorities\nThe macOS allows users to specify which certificate authorities (CA) can be used for trust evaluation during smartcard authentication. Only CAs listed in the TrustedAuthorities section of the SmartcardLogin.plist will be evaluated as trusted. This setting only works if `checkCertificateTrust` is set to either 1, 2, or 3 in `com.apple.security.smartcard`.\n\nTo get the SHA-256 hash in the correct format, run the following command within terminal:\n[source,bash]\n----\n\/usr\/bin\/openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in <issuer cert> | \/usr\/bin\/awk -F '=' '{print $2}' |  \/usr\/bin\/sed 's\/:\/\/g'\n----\n\nTo configure Trusted Authorities, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as below:\n\n[source,xml]\n----\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-\/\/Apple\/\/DTD PLIST 1.0\/\/EN\" \"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/DTDs\/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>AttributeMapping<\/key>\n    <dict>\n          <key>fields<\/key>\n          <array>\n              <string>NT Principal Name<\/string>\n          <\/array>\n          <key>formatString<\/key>\n          <string>Kerberos:$1<\/string>\n          <key>dsAttributeString<\/key>\n          <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities<\/string>\n    <\/dict>\n    <key>TrustedAuthorities<\/key>\n  <array>\n      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2<\/string>\n  <\/array>\n<\/dict>\n<\/plist>\n----\n\n[discrete]\n==== Smartcard Enforcement Exemption\n\n[discrete]\n===== Group Exemption\n\nStarting in macOS 10.15, enforcement on a system can be granularly configured by adding a field to `\/private\/etc\/SmartcardLogin.plist`. The `NotEnforcedGroup` can be added to the file to list a Directory group that will not be included in smartcard enforcement. In order to activate this feature, `enforceSmartCard` and `allowUnmappedUsers` must be applied via a configuration profile (`com.apple.security.smartcard`).\n\nTo configure the `NotEnforcedGroup`, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as follows:\n[source,xml]\n----\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-\/\/Apple\/\/DTD PLIST 1.0\/\/EN\" \"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/DTDs\/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>AttributeMapping<\/key>\n    <dict>\n          <key>fields<\/key>\n          <array>\n              <string>NT Principal Name<\/string>\n          <\/array>\n          <key>formatString<\/key>\n          <string>Kerberos:$1<\/string>\n          <key>dsAttributeString<\/key>\n          <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities<\/string>\n    <\/dict>\n    <key>TrustedAuthorities<\/key>\n  <array>\n      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2<\/string>\n  <\/array>\n    <key>NotEnforcedGroup<\/key>\n    <string>EXEMPTGROUP<\/key>\n<\/dict>\n<\/plist>\n----\n\nOnce a system is configured for the `NotEnforcedGroup` a user can be added to the assigned group by running the following:\n[source,bash]\n----\n\/usr\/sbin\/dseditgroup -o edit -a <exempt_user> -t user <notenforcegroup>\n----\n\n[discrete]\n===== User Exemption\n\nAlternatively, if a single user needs to be exempt for a period of time, `kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement` can be set in the user's Open Directory record.

Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Organizations may be subject to specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws, regulations, or policies. Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary, including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over time support the management of this residual

The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.\n\nNOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.\n\nFileVault is described in detail here: link:https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/security\/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e\/web[].\n\nFileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.\n\n[discrete]\n==== Using the fdesetup Command\nWhen enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.\n[source,bash]\n----\n\/usr\/bin\/fdesetup enable\n----\nRunning this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for `fdesetup`.\n\nNOTE: Apple has deprecated `fdesetup` command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS.\n\n[discrete]\n==== Using a Configuration Profile\n\nWhen managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type `com.apple.MCX.FileVault2`. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:\n\n[source,xml]\n----\n<key>Enable<\/key>\n<string>On<\/string>\n<key>Defer<\/key>\n<true\/>\n----\n[source,xml]\n----\n<key>Enable<\/key>\n<string>On<\/string>\n<key>UserEntersMissingInfo<\/key>\n<true\/>\n----\n\nIf using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.\n\nThe `UserEntersMissingInfo` key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately.\n\nWhen using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple's Developer site: link:https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/devicemanagement\/fderecoverykeyescrow[].\n\nIt's recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device.

Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.\n\nAlthough the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved.\n\nEmergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.\n\nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication\/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.\n\nIf temporary or emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access.

Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and\/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook\/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\n\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\n\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.\n","references":{"srg":["N\/A"],"cce":["CCE-92755-8"],"disa_stig":["N\/A"],"cis":{"benchmark":["N\/A"],"controls v8":["6.4"]},"800-53r5":["AC-19"],"cmmc":["AC.L2-3.1.18"],"cci":["N\/A"],"800-53r4":["N\/A"]},"fix":"This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.

Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.\n\nAlthough the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved.\n\nEmergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.\n\nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication\/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.\n","check":"The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.

Each layer of protection is comprised of one or more malicious code protection mechanisms, which are automatically implemented and which, collectively, meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for malicious code prevention.\n\n1. This  first layer of defense targets the distribution of malware; the aim is to prevent malware from ever launching.\nThe following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the first layer of protection against malicious code:\n*\tThe Apple App Store: the safest way to add new applications to a Mac is by downloading them from the App Store; all apps available for download from the App Store have been reviewed for signs of tampering and signed by Apple to indicate that the app meets security requirements and does not contain malware.\n*\tXProtect: a built-in, signature-based, anti-virus, anti-malware technology inherent to all Macs. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware.\n  *\tIn macOS 10.15 and all subsequent releases, XProtect checks for known malicious content when:\n    *\tan app is first launched,\n    *\tan app has been changed (in the file system), and\n    *\tXProtect signatures are updated.\n*\tYARA: another built-in tool (inherent to all Macs), which conducts signature-based detection of malware. Apple updates YARA rules regularly.\n*\tGatekeeper: a security feature inherent to all Macs; Gatekeeper scans apps to detect malware and\/or revocations of a developer's signing certificate and prevents unsafe apps from running.\n*\tNotarization: Apple performs regular, automated scans to detect signs of malicious content and to verify developer ID-signed software; when no issues are found, Apple notarizes the software and delivers the results of scans to the system owner.\n\n2. The second layer of defense targets malware that manages to appear on a Mac before it runs; the aim is to quickly identify and block any malware present on a Mac in order to prevent the malware from running and further spreading.\nThe following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the second layer of protection against malicious code:\n*\tXProtect (defined above).\n*\tGatekeeper (defined above).\n*\tNotarization (defined above).\n\n3.
